# distroinfo

`distroinfo` is a python module for parsing, validating and querying
distribution/packaging metadata stored in human readable and reviewable
text/YAML files.

This is a proper generic (re)implementation of
[rdoinfo](https://github.com/redhat-openstack/rdoinfo) parser which proved
well suited for the task of interfacing with distribution metadata in a human
friendly way. If you consider code reviews human friendly, that is.

`distroinfo` is a part of
[Software Factory project](https://softwarefactory-project.io/docs/)


## STATUS

`distroinfo` is available from Fedora/EPEL repos and is **BEING INTEGRATED**.

[rdopkg](https://github.com/softwarefactory-project/rdopkg) and
[DLRN](https://github.com/softwarefactory-project/DLRN) are first adopters.

`rdoinfo` compatibility is ensured through offline and online tests.

CI is enabled.

See [distroinfo reviews](https://softwarefactory-project.io/dashboard/project_distroinfo).

## Installation


### from source

If you want to hack `distroinfo` or just have the latest code without waiting
for next release, you can use the git repo directly:

    git clone https://github.com/softwarefactory-project/distroinfo
    cd distroinfo
    python setup.py develop --user

You may set the preference over `distroinfo` RPM by correctly positioning
`~/.local/bin/distroinfo` in your `$PATH`.

Or you can use virtualenv to avoid conflicts with RPM:

    git clone https://github.com/softwarefactory-project/distroinfo
    cd distroinfo
    virtualenv --system-site-packages ~/distroinfo-venv
    source ~/distroinfo-venv/bin/activate
    python setup.py develop
    ln `which distroinfo` ~/bin/distroinfo-dev

    distroinfo-dev --version

Required python modules are listed in
[requirements.txt](requirements.txt).


### from Fedora/EPEL repos (default)

`distroinfo` is available on **Fedora 27** and newer:

    dnf install python2-distroinfo

including Python 3 version:

    dnf install python3-distroinfo

On CentOS/RHEL 7, `distroinfo` is available from
[EPEL](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL).

On **CentOS 7**:

    yum install epel-release
    yum install python2-distroinfo

On **RHEL 7**:

    yum install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm
    yum install python2-distroinfo


### from PyPI

For your convenience, `distroinfo` is available from the Cheese Shop:

    pip install distroinfo


## Usage

    from distroinfo.info import DistroInfo

    RDOINFO_RAW_URL = \
        'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redhat-openstack/rdoinfo/master/'

    di = DistroInfo('rdo-full.yml',
                    remote_info=RDOINFO_RAW_URL)
    info = di.get_info()

You can also use `remote_git_info=GIT_URL` or `local_info=PATH` with
DistroInfo constructor.

You can navigate info structure yourself or use `query` module:

    from distroinfo import query

    # get a package info by strict package name
    nova = query.get_package(info, 'openstack-nova')

    # find a package by human reference (smart search)
    keystone = query.find_package(info, 'keystone')

Alternatively, you can get info with `packages` and `releases` as dictionaries
indexed by project/release name for easier access using `info_dicts=True`:

    info = di.get_info(info_dicts=True)
    nova = info['packages']['nova']

  `distroinfo` format usage
